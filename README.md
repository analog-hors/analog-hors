code horse.

I work primarily in Rust, but have also done work in Typescript, Javascript, C#, Java, and Python. Currently primarily interested in Chess related code. Maintainer of [`cozy-chess`](https://github.com/analog-hors/cozy-chess), a fast Chess and Chess960 move generation library written in Rust suitable for Chess engines.
